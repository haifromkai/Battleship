# About the Project
Name: Battleship <br>
Started: 4/16/24 <br>
Description: The project is a Java implementation of the classic Battleship game, comprising a modular architecture with ten distinct Java classes. It employs object-oriented programming principles, with each ship type (Battleship, Cruiser, Destroyer, Submarine, EmptySea) encapsulated in its respective class inheriting from an abstract Ship class. The Ocean class serves as the game board, managing ship placement and tracking hits and misses. Additional classes handle visual representation, ship placement logic, and player interaction. This project showcases different aspects in Java programming, including inheritance, abstraction, and encapsulation, as well as effective project organization and modular design, resulting in a functional and scalable implementation of the Battleship game.
